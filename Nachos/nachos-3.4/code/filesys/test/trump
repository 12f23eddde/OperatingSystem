1 GREATEST ELECTION FRAUD IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY!!!
2 Why isn’t Congress giving our people a Stimulus Bill?
3 It wasn’t their fault, it was the fault of China.
4 GET IT DONE, and give them more money in direct payments.
5 Martial law = Fake News. Just more knowingly bad reporting!
6 What would Bolton, one of the dumbest people in Washington, know?
7 Wasn’t he the person who so stupidly said, on television, “Libyan solution”,
8 when describing what the U.S. was going to do for North Korea?
9 I’ve got plenty of other Bolton “stupid stories”.
10 As badly as we were treated in Georgia by the “Republican” Governor and “Republican” Secretary of State,
11 we must have a massive victory for two great people, @KLoeffler & @sendavidperdue, on January 5th.
12 I will be having a big Rally for them on Monday night, January 4th. WIN!
13 Watch @RealPNavarro NOW on the Election Fraud. @JesseBWatters @FoxNews
14 The lie of the year is that Joe Biden won! Christina Bobb @OANN
15 We don’t want to have lockdowns. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself!
16 The entire WORLD is being badly hurt by the China Virus,
17 but if you listen to the Fake News Lamestream Media, and Big Tech,
18 you would think that we are the only one.
19 No, but we are the Country that developed vaccines, and years ahead of schedule!
20 Very happy to have helped get @WreathsAcross America so beautifully open and operating today.
21 Congratulations to all of those who have worked so hard for this great success!
22 The Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality.
23 I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control.
24 Russia, Russia, Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream is,
25 for mostly financial reasons, petrified of discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!).
26 There could also have been a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election,
27 which is now obvious that I won big, making it an even more corrupted embarrassment for the USA.
28 He didn’t win the Election.
29 He lost all 6 Swing States, by a lot.
30 They then dumped hundreds of thousands of votes in each one, and got caught.
31 Now Republican politicians have to fight so that their great victory is not stolen. Don’t be weak fools!
32 Peter Navarro releases 36-page report alleging election fraud 'more than sufficient' to swing victory to Trump.
33 A great report by Peter. Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election.
34 Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!
35 The Secretary of State and Governor of Georgia, both so-called “Republicans”,
36 aren’t allowing Fulton County to go through the vital Voter Signature Verification process.
37 Also, they are not allowing Republican “watchers” to be present and verify!
38 We won the Presidential Election, by a lot. FIGHT FOR IT. Don’t let them take it away!
39 Well, at least she was happy when I pardoned Scooter Libby. We got a GREAT new Senator from her state, not Liz!
40 I will Veto the Defense Bill, which will make China very unhappy. They love it.
41 Must have Section 230 termination, protect our National Monuments and allow for removal of military from far away,
42 and very unappreciative, lands. Thank you!
43 I am very disappointed in the United States Supreme Court, and so is our great country!
44 We won Wisconsin big. They rigged the vote!
45 Democrats would never put up with a Presidential Election stolen by the Republicans!
46 Just released data shows many thousands of noncitizens voted in Nevada. They are totally ineligible to vote!
47 Perhaps the biggest difference between 2016 and 2020 is @FoxNews,
48 despite the fact that I went from 63,000,000 Votes to 75,000,000 Votes, a record 12,000,000 Vote increase.
49 Obama went down 3,000,000 Votes, and won. Rigged Election!!!
50 GREATEST ELECTION FRAUD IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY!!!
