# Lab 1: Thread Mechanism

## Exercise 1: Research

> Difference between Linux PCB and Nachos mechanism

## Exercise 2: Trace source code

> Read the following code, understand current Nachos thread mechanism
> * `code/threads/main.cc`
> * `code/threads/threadtest.cc`
> * `code/threads/thread.h`
> * `code/threads/thread.cc`

## Exercise 3: Expand Thread data structure

> Add two member, *UID* (user id) and *TID* (thread id).
> Maintain these two number using existing Nachos thread management mechanism.

## Exercise 4: Add global Thread management mechanism

> 1. Make Nachos can handle maximum 128 threads at the same time.
> 2. Imitate Linux *ps* command. Add a *ts* (Threads Status) command which is able to show all the threads' information and status.
