# Lab 1: Thread Mechanism

## Exercise 1: Research

> Research the CPU (Process/Thread) scheduling algorithm of Linux or Windows

## Exercise 2: Trace source code

> Read the following code, understand current Nachos thread mechanism
> * `code/threads/scheduler.h`
> * `code/threads/scheduler.cc`
> * `code/threads/switch.s`
> * `code/threads/timer.h`
> * `code/threads/timer.cc`

## Exercise 3: Expand Thread scheduling algorithm

> Implement preemption algorithm based on priority

## Challenge 1: More expansion

> Implement Round Robin or Multilevel Feedback Queues. Or implement Linux or Windows's algorithm.
